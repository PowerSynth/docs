# Back-end documentation

This is the backend for the PowerSynth Web application. It provides a single endpoint for uploading and processing files through PowerSynth.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PowerSynth/back-end
cd back-end
npm install
```

~~You will also need to set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can copy the contents of `.env.example` and update the values as needed.~~

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```sh
npm run start
```

The server will start listening on port 3000 by default. You can change this by updating the `PORT` variable in your `.env` file.
