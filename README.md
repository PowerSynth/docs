# PowerSynth Web Docs

PowerSynth Web is a web-based version of PowerSynth, an electronic design automation (EDA) tool for optimizing multi-chip power module (MCPM) layouts. This organization houses the code for both the front-end and back-end of PowerSynth Web.

## Repositories

This organization has two main repositories:

### front-end

The `front-end` repository contains the code for the PowerSynth Web user interface (UI) and client-side functionality. This is the front-end portion of the web application, which users interact with to use PowerSynth Web.

### back-end

The `back-end` repository contains the code for the PowerSynth Web server and back-end functionality. This is the back-end portion of the web application, which processes user requests and runs the PowerSynth optimization algorithms.
